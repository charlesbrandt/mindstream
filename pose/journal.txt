requested [2012.12.01 11:25:59] 
make application-split.py the main file...
does application still have anything of relevance?
#2012.01.27 13:26:04 
pose/application-split.py is the one most used...
is it time to get rid of pose/application.py?

also [2012.08.23 09:59:00] 
split at least implies that there is a second process that is needed
(because it does not load the journal data)

also [2012.12.01 11:27:06] 
that should be explained on the home page if the second process has not been loaded.

default screen should not check for a remote journal
should show a summary of what is available...
then links to common options...

can't always remember the different options

A collection of scripts, applications and modules for use with the moments library. These applications include a desktop application for creating moments/journals, scripts for sorting and processing moments, web based application to browse moments, and a desktop application to help with manually tagging moments.

I think this was added last month
requested [2012.11.04 11:44:33] 
add recent months to top nav
timeline takes too long to load
and usually is not what I'm after when searching based on time...
usually want to look at what was happening comprehensively in a specific range of days or week (based on a given relevant moment found via tags)

*2012.08.23 09:54:31 
following items were in the header of application split
I think they are complete by now!

seems like:
http://localhost:8088/range/201202/20120229235959
should work
it shows cloud in addition to entries
requested [2011.09.07 11:38:00] pose

recreating RemoteJournal for each request fixes this, and does not cause any delays
requested [2011.10.10 08:34:13] 
why does connection to json / remote server disappear?
maybe need to figure out jsonp

got this working a few days ago. it's cool!

use an auto complete, javascript form to "search" for matching tags

can do this a number of different ways now using moments2.RemoteJournal
requested [2011.04.18 19:16:47] 
way to reload / rescan currently loaded journal/mindstream
without shutting down the server
that way can launch the server interactively
and keep it running
without restarting to pick up changes
(would be nice if reload was intelligent)

bottle.TEMPLATE_PATH.append('./templates/')

that is what is used everywhere else
'views' is hard to remember
