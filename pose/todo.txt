way to search entries
(right now just do a grep -r ...)

*2014.11.02 15:05:06 
way to extract from directly within pose
see pending extract requests
show trial extraction before saving results

way to store the loaded data from text journals into a database of sorts
would also be nice to have a 'watch' style aspect that keeps track of when files have changed on the filesystem and then load any of those changes automatically into the database. (should persist across system reboots if possible)

*2012.08.23 09:49:54 
would be nice to have editing capabilities built in to pose "/tagged/[tag]" listing
this would make it easier to edit/update entry data
tags could be added and removed

it would also be really cool to be able to drag the "*" of a specific moment to the tag that takes priority in order to re-organize a specific file
that action could move the moment from its current source text file to the default destination text file for the new tag.  (ideally it would also update this information in any memory indexes for the loaded journal)

that way, when loading the source text file outside of pose, everything should be targeted to that specific context

edit mode for files
similar to 
/path

*2011.08.15 06:56:37 
should be 2 different ways to edit...
1) launch editor on local machine if source is local
2) launch text entry field in browser that submits file changes to server (works remotely).  This should also have a configurable text entry field... might be good to use javascript to customize behavior

*2012.08.02 22:44:33 
add in sorting mechanism
consider best way for grouping

cloud listing

*2011.09.07 11:41:52 pose
scan a directory with photos
convert to moments, adding tags based on directory
then import to pose
should do this dynamically (static files won't always reflect latest tags based on path)

*2010.05.06 16:58:33 
integrate journal w/ photos w/ audio/ etc
make a summary view of all of those for each day

*2011.12.31 12:33:50 
when launching
use moment.source to find source
if source is not being kept through web version, add that back in (should be there though)
