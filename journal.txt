this was started in README.txt
anything more should be requested specifically
requested [2012.08.23 09:57:39] documentation

time to publish!

these don't need to be here... they can be their own future project!
requested [2011.08.01 10:57:48] 
merge player, communicate and /c/scripts (public) in with mindstream

*2012.01.27 13:25:26 complete
requested [2011.09.14 16:23:55] 
recreate mindstream mercurial repository to get rid of personal data

*2012.01.27 12:19:01 
moved relevant / useful classes in cycles to moments.timestamp module.
if it's deemed redundant to contents of Timerange, can update referencing code as needed.

*2012.01.27 11:56:15 
have some reservation about including playlist/ and mindstream/sources.py mindstream/cycles.py

but it seems like enough other scripts rely on those, that even if they're not directly related to mindstream (e.g. there is a better place for them ultimately), they need to be available. 

also [2012.12.01 11:07:12] 
this was a good thought, but the right destination did not exist yet...
now it does:
medley

moving those items there now

I think this has been confirmed, established
requested [2011.08.01 11:09:44] 
thinking that mindstream is the higher level module to contain things like player, communicate, etc
not sure if pose2 is included, or separate.

requested [2011.06.26 12:20:12] 
best way to integrate moments and mindstream



*2011.09.09 12:56:09 
these were all completed during last synchronization process

requested [2011.08.15 06:59:33] 
make mindstream a python module
available for import

this is tricky
have tried to do something similar in communicate module
things end up getting very nested and deep in their structure
which makes it difficult to find when navigating via the command line 
(e.g. for scripts)

requested [2011.08.01 11:00:35] 
merge /c/scripts (non-public) 

requested [2011.08.01 11:10:44] 
should be an easily launchable launcher (areaui/examples/launcher.py?)
should easily show all available options / modules / etc




*2011.06.26 12:17:54 
not sure if mindstream should be in the same position as moments.scripts

want to separate any higher level functions of journal into a separate module...
keep things in moments as bare bones as possible

this is the place to flesh things out
