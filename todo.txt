should have a format for browser 
represent heirarchies 
so they can be navigated with left, right, up down
different zoom levels

*2011.01.17 22:14:36 summary object summarize
a way to automatically summarize a day...
tag cloud for the day, but base it on time?
can then compare that with priorities
(if one day is possible, should be possible with other time frames)

load a journal
extract a day (e.g. yesterday)
generate timeline based on tags
if there are gaps, it will be imprecise
but that is better than nothing

after a pause
options from root should start floating at random
a mouse movement in that direction should tune to branches in that vicinity
a click should navigate to that node, then continue the random options
double click to lock on that node and navigate it as normal (scrollable)
