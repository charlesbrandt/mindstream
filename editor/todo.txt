investigate kivy... 
consider recreating this editor in it
would be nice to have a smooth tranistion

mindstream edit, select text doesn't work on netbook... why?
also a kill line (ctrl-k) like emacs would also help with this

last timestamp is helpful for noting when last entry was completed
but it might also be nice to access a hidden option (on mouse over, show button... upper left or right corner of screen)
to see recent history
could even be an editing instance, similar to this one
toward the right
